There are some among us who are known for obsessing over every little detail; making sure everything is perfectly planned out. Guilty? Yeah, me too!

Alright, so adding Spanish to the list would seem a little too unrealistic – especially since travelling for medical purposes doesn’t always allow the time to sit down and learn an entire language or even un poquito. But let me ask you a few questions:

* What can you expect from dentists in Mexico if it’s a developing nation?
* What about the dental costs in Mexico?  
* Have the practitioners received essential training for me to trust them with my smile, let alone my life?

I mean, I asked myself this: Are my kidneys going to disappear? (I probably had a few more concerns than you – but if not, then welcome to the club)



## Quality

Sure, Mexico is known for being an amazing tourist destination – a trap even. It’s known for its cultural heritage and warm culture, but for having world renown and reputable medical and dental practitioners? Really? Really. 

You can expect to walk into a top-of-the-line dental office equipped with the latest technology to provide you with the highest quality of service you seek – the hang up? None really, and it’s only a fraction of the cost.

This is why I got involved with NeighborHealth. We have sought out not only the most reputable practitioners, we have done so in one of the safest parts of the country, Monterrey. As a sceptic, I couldn’t fathom how a Mexican practice would compare to those “near me” in the USA, Canada, or Europe – well, they do, and consistently exceed the quality of service we can get at home. However, I was blown away at the quality, cleanliness and amazing service – and guaranteed zero kidney removal.



## Safety

Safety is always a big concern for anyone. NeighborHealth ensures your safety by providing you with rides to and from the airport, and in between your appointments. There is no getting lost, no guess work, and no need to learn Spanish overnight. 

NighborHealth Advantage

NieghborHealth provides you with discounted access to tourist attractions all over town.

Are there limited services offered?

No, anything from dental implants all the way through to cosmetic dentistry, our network dentists have the credentials, and the skills to provide you with what your smile needs.

So, what are the perks of going on down to Mexico?

Well, it is a tourist’s playground after-all. The mountain views, an oasis in the desert, the cultural experience, and the food; oh! the food!  Have we mentioned how all these high-quality services are only a fraction of the cost? They are. Insurance costs are sky-rocketing, and these services at home can be pricey. Imagine saving up to an average of 75% on certain procedures’ costs.

I get it. It’s okay to be skeptical! But let NeighborHealth provide you with peace of mind during your trip.
