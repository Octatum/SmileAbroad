Sure, traveling isn’t always possible, especially when you have so many other priorities to take care of.

But what if you could incorporate traveling into one of your “need to do” items?

That’s the magic of **medical tourism**. You get to travel to a new location while you take care of medical procedures and with **NeighborHealth** you can take care of **dental implants**, **dentures**, tooth extraction, root canal, cosmetic dentistry **and more**.

## 6 months ago..

**Before I joined** NeighborHealth I had some serious misconceptions and **questions** that needed attention **before** I would **venture **out to Monterrey, **Mexico**:

> Why would I go risk my health and get **dental implants in Mexico?**
>
> Do **Mexican health standards **meet those of my practitioners at home?
>
> Wouldn’t it be cheaper for me to **stay home **and get this done?
>
> **I don’t know anyone **in the destination I want to go to that I can get to help me plan my trip!
>
> How can I **trust **someone who is roughly 2000 miles away?

What I learned along the way propelled me to eventually take my own trip down to Monterrey and discover not only what **NeighborHealth** could do, but how good they are at **minimizing the risks.**

For me, it was the **rigorous standards** that NeighborHealth has for their practitioners; they **must speak English**, each practitioner **must be insured**, each must have **international experience** and accreditation, and access to **top of the line equipment.** These factors, which NeighborHealth actively regulates, ensure that the **quality** of the treatments you receive match or exceed anything that you could get in North America.

## Savings and payment

Then you have the local currency (the Mexican Peso); which is roughly 1 USD > 20 MXN. Your money goes much further in Mexico. 

But that’s just it. . . money 

>  How could I trust sending money to Mexico? 

The reality is that the world is more interconnected than ever. The **first payment is simply to secure the services.** Depending on the treatment, you could save anywhere from **40-70 percent** – the money left over is where the tourism aspect comes in. You could visit **museums**, enjoy **cultural shows** and **experiences**; relax in all the beautiful nature that surrounds the Monterrey Valley – an oasis in the middle of a desert. 

**NeighborHealth** constantly monitors possible **discounts**, shows, museum exhibits, and helps you build an ideal **itinerary** (this part is **absolutely free**). Thus removing the anxiety that comes from planning a trip – it sounds nice and dandy, doesn’t it? Because it is! 

## How to get started

The NeighborHealth teams eagerly tries to make your trip planning as smooth as possible – all they need to know are the **dates you’re planning to fly**, your **likes** and **dislikes**, and what **type of treatment** you need done (all on 4 dental implants, tooth extraction, veneers, root canal) - all at no cost to you with the [free assessment](http://nissimdev--neighbor-health.netlify.com/get-started) located on their website.

Have you ever tried to plan something with someone who was far away?

Try joining a multi-lingual business halfway through the launch phase. That’s where I was roughly 6 months ago.  At first, I was uncertain because of all the inherent risk. After a few weeks, I had been introduced to the whole NeighborHealth team and I saw their desire to help, to innovate, and to revolutionize the way that you perceive your medical needs – not as a burden, but as an opportunity to travel, to explore, to relax, and to heal naturally. 

I made my trip down to Monterrey in **June 2018** to see if all the planning translated into actionable procedures. The **team is present**, they are there to help you every step of the way - you even get a direct line to contact your NeighborHealth representative.

The medical professional facilities and their staff are eager to serve you, to get you looking great, and feeling great.

This is the power of **NeighborHealth**, your helping hand at home and abroad. The trustworthy, up-and-coming future of medical treatments.

All I call tell you is, go ahead, [**plan your trip with NeighborHealth**](http://nissimdev--neighbor-health.netlify.com/get-started), you won’t regret the quality of the treatment and the personalized service.
