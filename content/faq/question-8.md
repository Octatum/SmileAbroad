Mexicoâ€™s economic structure is much different than in North America and Europe. Thus your **currency** can be used to do more. Despite this all, Mexico has been able to imitate the U.S world-renowned health care system, in terms of **quality** and access to **technology.** 

Doctors in the US are required to pay expensive certifications and permissions - and not to mention the high costs of establishing a dental facility. The **cost of labor**, real estate values and government taxes are some factors as well. 

Due to the economic differences, Mexican practitioners have access to similar technologies and can provide the same quality procedures for a **fraction of the cost. **
