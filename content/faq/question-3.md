Every associated dental clinic is strictly selected because they meet or exceed the NeighborHealth certification, which includes:

* An on-site inspection by NeighborHealth Management
* Up-to-date instrumentation, and equipment
* Practitioner experience and certifications
* On-site security
* Welcoming facilities

Moreover, NeighborHealth chooses only the best dentists - comparable to top-rated U.S. dental clinics.
